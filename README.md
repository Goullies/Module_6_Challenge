## Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco


# Overview of Challenge 6

In this challenge, my job was to use your data visualisation skills, including aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

I have used the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook and `sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv` file to visualise and analyse the real-estate data using hvPlot and GeoViews. 
I have created the DataFrame and used these in the analysis.

Tasked that have been completed included:

* Calculate and plot the housing units per year.

* Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.

* Compare the average prices by neighborhood.

* Build an interactive neighborhood map.

* Compose your data story.

Close attention was placed on the professional styles and formats that were requested as part of this assignment.


Trends were analysis and examples given after the dta ws aggregated and presented in the interactive visualisations.

Based on these visualisations, I was able to report on the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices and whether this was representative for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco?

Fianllay I conclused with insights for the company regarding the risks I seen in the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they were pursuing and suggested a word of caution for this investment strategy.
